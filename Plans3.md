Add additional hotkey after typing in stock name manually, that takes roughly 2k and does market buy with a 1.2 to 1.5 limit sell. Stop loss at 1%(could do 0.7 to 1.2).

Should work for 5 - 10 seconds falls of 2 - 3% from stable downturns not falls from runners, with 5 seconds stagnated/or green candle up 0.3%. Average holding time is just under a minute. Un summary, it takes 5 - 10 seconds to fall 2% and it takes like 6 times as long to recover half of it. 

Uses either his previous alerts from the day, or stocks he says he's watching in chat, premovers(possibly but requires more work going through them, preferably just rely on the the first two options to pick from). Utilizes stocks that are volatile enough for 2 - 3% drops to occur every.

EX: GROM on Oct 8th morning of.
